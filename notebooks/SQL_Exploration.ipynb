Or, comprised of 70 percent indica genetics, is an Israeli strain from the medical cannabis supplier Tikun Olam. Primarily designed for patients with sleep disorders, Or also remedies an array of other symptoms including nausea, pain, inflammation, indigestion, and appetite loss. The One, originally bred by\\xa0Clackamas Coots or CC, is a perfectly balanced hybrid of two landrace strains. It is sometimes referred to by its genetic combination Thai x Pure Afghan, with its sativa heritage stemming from its Thai background and the Afghan influence bringing a thick resinous frosting of trichomes. This specific combination of two cornerstone landrace strains is known to only be available through a select circle of breeders and growers in Oregon.\\xa0')"
